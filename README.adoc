= Toulouse JAM Workshop infrastructure  

== About

This repository contains all the stuff needed to provision a Jenkins master, a SonarQube instance and some staging/"prod" environments for a workshop usecase.

All machines are provisioned using Terraform/Ansible and Docker on the DigitalOcean cloud.

Jenkins master is automatically configured with the DigitalOcean Plugin which permits to dynamically provision Jenkins agents on demand.

== Prerequisites

It's assume that : 

* you are on a Linux system (only tested on Fedora 25)
* you have ansible and terraform installed locally (tested with ansible==2.3.0 and terraform==0.7.10)
* a variable DO_API with DigitalOcean credentials is exported on the current shell
* a ssh key pair is available on the root of this repository (id_rsa_jam, id_rsa_jam.pub), and must be added to your DigitalOcean settings

Since the SSH key pair is created on your own laptop, you need to adapt provisoning files with your own credentials.

* Update `ssh_keys` property of `jenkins-masters/jenkins-masters.tf`, `environments/environments.tf` and `sonarqube/sonarqube.tf` Terraform provisioning files with the fingerprint of the dedicated SSH public key (you can easily get it from DigitalOcean settings)

== Machines creation

Inside each directory (`jenkins-masters`, `sonarqube`, `environments`), you can access some kind of provisioning commands.

.Display terraform execution plan to provision X machines :
[source,bash]
----
$> make plan n=X
----

.Trigger provisioning of X machines :
[source,bash]
----
$> make provision n=X
----

This action will create (or update) X new machines on DigitalOcean cloud accordingly to the configuration specified into `jenkins-masters/jenkins-masters.tf`, `environments/environments.tf` or `sonarqube/sonarqube.tf` files.
Then, a provisioning with Ansible playbooks (see `*.yml` files inside each directory) is triggered on all created/updates machines with a dynamic inventory of Ansible.

CAUTION: this action is strictly idempotent. It means that if you start with "make provision n=5" and then execute "make provision n=4", the fifth machine will be directly deleted by terraform !!
To be sure, first run "make plan n = X" and read carefully what are Terraform's plans before a "make provision" action.

=== What's the username/password of my instance ?

By default, Jenkins master are provisioned with :

* login = jenkins-${counter}
* password = ${digitalocean_droplet_id}

.You can display all ip/login/password provisioned with Terraform using the following command :
[source,bash]
----
$> make infos
----

=== Display Jenkins logs of a target machine

.Assuming you have direct access to target machine (ssh key pushed), you can execute the following command :
[source,bash]
----
$> make logs jenkins-2
----

=== Connect to a target machine

.Assuming you have direct access to target machine (ssh key pushed), you can execute the following command :
[source,bash]
----
$> make go jenkins-10
----


=== Generate all informations for attendees

You can launch the script `gen-txt.sh` to create one file per attendee containing all dedicated instances informations.
All files are created inside a `_dist` directory.

== Known limitations

Jenkins DigitalOcean Plugin needs to have your "ssh_key_id" number during provisioning (see jenkins-masters/jenkins-provisioning.yml#14). This is a DigitalOcean specific number and it's completely dependant of your DigitalOcean settings. To retrieve this number, the only way I found is to configure manually the plugin the first time, retrieve the config.xml of Jenkins and get this number from the file.

CAUTION: DigitalOcean sets a limit of number of Droplets. You need to increase both on DigitalOcean side (a dedicated form is available on DigitalOcean website) and on  the file `jenkins-masters/jenkins-provisioning.yml` depending on the number of attendees.

CAUTION: Since all Jenkins instances share the same DigitalOcean API key, you are limited by link:https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/v2/#rate-limit[DigitalOcean API Rate Limit].

CAUTION: the `instanceCap` property specified inside the Jenkins DigitalOcean plugin configuration is global to all attendees (since it's the same API key for each attendee).

== Further improvements

There are some "code duplication" and limitations that could be improved here.

* We could have a "meta" Makefile on the root and add a kind of `action` targeting a specific directory. For example : `make jenkins provision n=2`
* The script `terraform-inventory.py` used to create a dynamic inventory of Ansible and Terraform is currently duplicated on each subdirectory
* The SSH key pair informations specified could be specified more dynamically using Terraform variables.
* The `digitalocean.tf` file is also duplicated on each subdirectory

Yeah, it's a little dirty, but those scripts have been evolved/improved in hurry ! And PRs are always welcome :-)
